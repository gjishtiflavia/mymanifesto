      <h1>My Design Manifesto </h1>
<p1> Design is powerful.It is like a bridge that connects people through
imagery, type, and visions. I want to make a difference in the society.
I want my design to transmit a positive message. Principles of design such as
hierarchy, space, contrast, and emphasis guide my work.</p1>

      <h2>Promises</h2>
<p2> I love to create and I can’t imagine a version of myself that doesn’t
   include design. Design has become an extension of my mind, and body.</p2>

<p3>I will learn a new skill everyday in Adobe programs (Photoshop, In Design,
After Effects, Illustrator).</p3>

<p4>I will educate my eye through conferences, video tutorials, or documentaries
about design.</p4>

<p5>It will be like a rollercoaster-with its ups and downs but I am not giving up.
  I will find a way to make it fun anyways! </p5>

<p6>Courage, commitment, passion, and intuition will always be my companions in
solving Design problems.</p6>

<p7>I will be patient and not throw tamper tantrums.</p7>

<p8>I will save everything. I might use it for future projects.</p8>

<p9>Whenever I feel like my creative process is not going smoothly, I will take
short breaks in between- I will go for a walk, eat dark chocolate, dance, or
listen to Greek, Albanian, or Latin music.</p9>

<p10>I will also work on my posture while working in the computer so that I don’t
end up like a real Golden Ratio.</p10>

<p11>I believe in my artistic abilities, sharp eye for details and passionate self.
I am ready to work hard and willing to do my best to make a difference and
move the society forward through visual communication.</p11>
