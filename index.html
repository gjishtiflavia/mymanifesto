      <h1>My Design Manifesto </h1>


<h2> Design is powerful.
It is like a bridge that connects people through imagery, type, and visions.
I want to make a difference in the society.
I want my design to transmit a positive message.
Principles of design such as hierarchy, space, contrast, and emphasis guide my work.</h2>

<h3> I <b>LOVE</b> to create and I can’t imagine a version of myself that doesn’t
   include design. Design has become an extension of my mind, and body.</h3>

<h4>Promises</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">

<li>I will learn at least a new skill every week in Adobe programs (Photoshop, In Design,
After Effects, Illustrator). </li>

<li>I will educate my eye through conferences, video tutorials, or documentaries
about design.</li>

<li>It will be like a rollercoaster-with its ups and downs but I am not giving up.
  I will find a way to make it fun anyways!</li>

<li>Courage, commitment, passion, and intuition will always be my companions in
solving Design problems.</li>

<li>I <b> will </b> be patient.</li>

<li>I will save everything. I might use it for future projects.</li>

<li>Whenever I feel like my creative process is not going smoothly, I will take
short breaks in between- I will go for a walk, eat dark chocolate, dance, or
listen to Greek, Albanian, or Latin music.</li>

<li>I will also work on my posture while working in the computer so that I don’t
end up like a real Golden Ratio.</li>

<li>I believe in my artistic abilities, sharp eye for details and passionate self.
I am ready to work hard and willing to do my best to make a difference and
move the society forward through visual communication.</li

</ul>
