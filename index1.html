        <h2>1.Forget all the standard art forms.</h2>
    <div class=''green'>

<p> Don't paint pictures, don't make poetry, don't build architecture,don't arrange
dances, don't write plays, don't compose music, don't make moves, and above all,
don't think you'll get a happening out of putting all these together. This idea
is nothing more than what operas always did and you see it today in the far-out
types of discotheques with their flashing lights and film projections.The point
is to make something new, something that doesn't even remotely remind you of
culture.You've got to be pretty ruthless about this, wiping out of your plans
every echoof this or that story or jazz piece or painting that I can promise
you will keep coming up unconsciously.
</p>
     <h3>2.You can steer clear of art by mixing up your happening by mixing it with
     life situations.</h3>

<p> Make it unsure even to yourself if the hapenning is art or life. Art has always
been different from world's affairs, now you've got to work hard to keep it all
blurry.Two cars collide on a highway.Violet liquid pours out of the broker
radiator of one of them, and in the back seat of the other there, is a huge
load of dead chickens that is spilling out all over the groud. The cops check it
out, plausible answers are given, tow trucks carry of the wrecks costs arepaid
and the drivers go home to dinner.
</p>
      <h4> 3.The situations for a happening should come from what you see in the real
      world, from places and people rather than from the head.</h4>

<p> If you stick to imagination too much, you will end up with old art again, since
art was always supposed to be made from Imagination. Take advantage of the ready
made events: a factory fire, the fire trucks screaming to it from all the sides,
the water, the police barricades, the red blinkers- a natural. Or after a storm
at the shore, the debris wash up can be terriffic. Or just take an afternoon off
and watch women trying on dresses in a bargain basement. An awful lot can be done
with images like these. If you get stuck for ideas, an exception to the slice-of
-life idea is the greatest source book of our time, the yellow pages of the
telephone directory. Break open the book at random, point your figner down at
some point in the page and you'll come up with: private detective service, rug
cleaning at home, cement block, airport limousine transport, judo lessons. You
can get more out of these than out all of Beethoven, Michelangelo, and Racine
put together.
